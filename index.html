        <p1>Hi, I'm Mathew. I'm a former Controls Engineer at Dow Chemical. I have always been passionate to code and my interest in coding was amplified while working with a Fortran based DCS system at DOW. I am currently looking to pursue a long term career in Software Engineering and Development of mordern coding languages and frameworks. I am an alumnus of University of Houston where I did my Masters in Electrical Engineering. I also have a Bachelor of Technology degree in Electronics from VIT University, India.</p1>
        <p></p>
        <br>
        <p2>I am passionate to learn new programming languages and I actively look for material to keep myself updated on time complexity of code and systems design while using different programming languages. My hobbies include assembling and fixing up computer hardware, emulating systems through virtual machines or homebrew emulators for legacy video game consoles.</p2>
